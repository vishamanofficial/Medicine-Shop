1. PROBLEM DEFINITION
Medicines are one of the essential requirements of human life , which are needed by almost
everyone at some time. To make the process of buying and the selling medicines in a more
smooth way, this project is very useful. Sometimes, in the farther areas or rural areas medicines
are out of reach for people there. Also, old people in society whose children’s live away from
them, finds this process very hectic. Therefore to ease there work it is the basic requirement of
modern times.
There are a number of different services performed by pharmacists in the different countries
that matches CP’s role in primary healthcare. These are services range from the traditional
distribution services to more advanced disease management services. Moreover the
pharmaceutical services have been considered extremely valuable for professionals, patients
and these of healthcare systems, mainly due to a greater efficiency and improvement in
individual patient’s health related outcomes.
2. REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS
To provide computerized data storage facility. We can search easily any record. The new
system requires less time for completion of any work. All the stock of medicine is updated
automatically in the new system. The system is more user friendly and anyone having computer
knowledge can handle it easily and efficiently. Suitability for computerized data entry.
Maintaining stocks, Supplier’s information, Customer information & bill information are easy.3. Modules

4.2.2. Visual studio 2010.
4.2.3. Bootstrap
5. TOOLS DESCRIPTION
This project is developed with Bootstrap, Html, CSS, JavaScript and Ajax, J query as Web
Application.
5.1. HTML :- Html is the standard mark-up language used to create web pages, Web browsers
can read Html files and render them into visible or audible web pages. Html elements form the
building blocks of all websites. Html allows images and objects to be embedded and can beused to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings
paragraphs list links quotes and other items.
5.2. CSS :- CSS is a webpage derived from multiple sources with a defined order of precedence
Where the definitions of any style element conflict the cascading style sheet level one
recommendation from the worldwide web consortium (W3C) which is then implemented in all
the modern web browsers specifies the possible style sheet statement that may determine how
a given element is presented in the webpage and describe how Html element are to be displayed
on screen paper or in other media CSS.
5.3. BOOTSTRAP :- Bootstrap is a free and open source CSS framework directed at responsive
mobile first front end web development it contains CSS and JavaScript based design templates
for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components.
5.4. JAVASCRIPT :- JavaScript often abbreviated on JS, is a programming language that
confirms to the ECMA Script specification run JavaScript is a high level of in just in time
compiled and multi paradigm. It has curly brackets in tax dynamic typing prototype based object
orientation and first class functions.
5.5. AJAX :- Asynchronous JavaScript and XML is a set of block development techniques using
many web technologies on the client side to create a synchronous web application with Ajax
web application can send and retrieve data from server asynchronously without interfering with
the display and behaviour of the existing page.
6. METHOD
Prototyping model has been used to develop this application the prototyping model is a
technique for quickly building a function but incomplete model of the information system there
are several kinds of prototype but they all intend to reduce this by building a quick and dirty
replica or mark-up of the included system.Prototype

Figure 1: Prototyping Model Process.
6.1. ANALYSIS
It is the first and foremost step of any project. In this, we try to analysis the problems and it’s
required solutions. Thereafter, the steps that are outlined in process improvement plan. It is used
identify the necessary improvements needed in the project plan. This type of analysis looks into
the problems experienced and other non-value added activities that are identified during the
process operation.
6.2. DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE
The prototype stage is when you create a model designed to solve consumers' problems or
validate ideas you can test in the next stage of the process. The prototype, as we see in the Apple
example above, should be quick, cheap and easy. Why? Because it only needs to be functionalenough for users to handle or explore it, but not so expensive or timely that it becomes a massive
undertaking.
6.3. IMPLEMENT
Implementation in the real world rarely follows a linear path from one step to the next, but
research indicates that there are generally four stages in implementing any intervention. The
first two stages involve exploratory and planning activities. In stage three the intervention is
implemented for the first time, reviewed and improved, before being fully implemented in the
fourth stage.
Each stage needs time and attention. It is important to be patient and not to skip any of the
stages. Rushing through stages will not adequately compensate for this need.
6.4. TEST
The outline the scope and objectives after understanding the product domain. The team then
analysis the risks involved and defines time schedules and testing environments to create astrategy. After that, management finalizes the tools and assigns roles and responsibilities to
individuals. An approximate timeline is also defined by which the testing of each module should
be completed. The most important delivery generated in this step is the test plan, which is a
document describing the motivation and details of the testing activities for a given project.
6.5. MAINTAIN
Project maintenance—the process of tracking and enabling project activities in accordance with
the project plan—is an essential, but often overlooked, factor in overall project success. After
spending so much time in the planning phase, many project managers have a tendency to take
a step back once the other members of the project team start their work, but experienced project
managers know that project monitoring is every bit as important as project planning.
Enterprise projects, in particular, require a steady commitment to project maintenance, simply
because they tend to have much longer durations than projects undertaken at smaller
organizations. The longer a project runs, the more likely it becomes that a small deviation from
the project plan will snowball into a serious issue as the project progresses.
7. PROCESS
7.1. Prototyping
7.2. Initial Requirements
7.3. Design
7.4. Customer evaluation
7.5. Review and update
7.6. Test and maintainFigure 2: Prototype Model Phases.
PHASE 1: IDENTIFY SOME REQUIREMENTS TO BEGIN WITH :-
Get list of Some major requirements which define the need for the new system including the
main input output information.
PHASE 2: DEVELOP INITIAL PROTOTYPE:
Develop a basic initial prototype which only has UI screens.PHASE 3: REVIEW THE PROTOTYPE:-
End users and SME’s (small and medium enterprise) work at examine the prototype and
prototype provide feedback for improvement/enhancements.
PHASE 4: REVISE AND ENHANCE THE PROTOTYPE:
Scope is changed based Feedback from end users and the prototype is enhanced and refined to
accom1modate user feedback.
8. ADVANTAGES
• User can view details of the medicines without going anywhere.
• It is convenient for users as this system provides accurate cost and description of the
system.
• The website is flexible to be used and for e-shopping.
• User can view different categories of product of different pharma company at a single
place.
• The products are delivered to the customer in his/her house so this becomes more
convenient for them.
9. DISADVANTAGES
• Does not keep track of stock.
• The user cannot view the product in person.
• There is no human interaction.
• There can be fraud and security problems.10. FUTURE SCOPE
Some ideas and features can be considered as a future work for this project. These features can
be summarised in the following points:
10.1. Suggest patients alternate cheap and effective medicines.
10.2. Let patients consult doctors online.
10.3. Suggest medicines according to symptoms filled by patient.
10.4. Create an awareness regarding different diseases, its causes and cure.
